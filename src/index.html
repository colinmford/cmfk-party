            <h1>Where to Stay</h1>
            <div class="text-section l-cols-2">
                <p><strong>The Maritime Hotel</strong><br/>The Maritime is the hotel we will be staying at. It is only a few blocks from the Chelsea Piers (and it looks like a boat!). You can <a href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=76630&Chain=21618&group=1709FORD%2fH&arrive=9/15/2017&depart=9/16/2017" target="_blank">book online</a> but you can only book 1 room at a time and just for the nights of the wedding. If you would like to book more than one room at once or for a longer stay, you should call them @ <a href="tel:+12122424300">212-242-4300</a> and say you&#8217;re booking for the &#8220;Ford / Hale Wedding.&#8221;</p>
                <p><strong>The Gild Hall</strong><br/>The Gild Hall is downtown in the Financial District. Same as The Maritime above, you can <a href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=59796&Chain=15564&arrive=9/16/2017&depart=9/18/2017&adult=1&child=0&group=1709HALEFO" target="_blank">book online</a> but you can only book 1 room at a time and just for the nights of the wedding. If you would like to book more than one room at once or for a longer stay you should call them @ <a href="tel:+12122327700">212-232-7700</a> and say you&#8217;re booking for the &#8220;Ford / Hale Wedding.&#8221;</p>
                <p><strong>Other Hotels</strong><br/>If you find a place to stay that better suits you, we encourage it. Our family have enjoyed staying uptown at <a href="https://www.nylohotels.com/nyc" target="_blank">The Nylo hotel</a> and the <a href="http://www.excelsiorhotelny.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Excelsior</a> in the past. Other cool hotels closer to Chelsea are <a href="http://www.thejanenyc.com/" target="_blank">The Jane</a> (you can save money by sharing a bathroom with other guests), <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-standard-new-york.html" target="_blank">The Standard Highline</a> (AMAZING views), or <a href="http://thehighlinehotel.com/" target="_blank">The Highline Hotel</a> (a former seminary in lower Manhattan). If you are a fan of chain hotels, there is a <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycws-new-york-marriott-downtown/" target="_blank">Mariott</a> just down the street. We also encourage guests to consider <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/New-York" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> to get a true NYC experience!</p>

            <h1>Travel to NYC</h1>
            <div class="text-section l-cols-2">
                <p><strong>By Air:</strong><br/> NYC airports are John F. Kennedy International (JFK), Newark (EWR), and LaGuardia (LGA). All airports are serviced by taxis (follow the signs to the taxi stand), car services and public transportation that will whisk you into the island of Manhattan in 30-60 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>By Train:</strong><br/> Travel into NYC by Amtrak to New York Pennsylvania Station (NYP), then take a taxi or the subway to your hotel.</p>
                <p><strong>By Car:</strong><br/> From points south, take the New Jersey Turnpike. Travel into Manhattan via the Holland Tunnel (lower Manhattan), Lincoln Tunnel (midtown), or the George Washington Bridge (uptown). All have tolls. Parking is limited in the city, but do-able. Street parking availability and rules will vary, so check street signs. Parking garages are also available all over the city.</p>

            <h1>Getting to the Venue</h1>
            <div class="text-section l-cols-2">
                <p>The <em>Aqua Azul</em> will be moored at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2ei52i2FMtn" target="_blank">Chelsea Piers, Pier 60,</a> nearest to 20th street and 11th avenue. She will be docked on the north side of the pier (right side, if you are facing the Hudson River), halfway back. Don&#8217;t worry, there will be signs!<br/></p>

                <p><strong>By Cab or Car Service (recommended):</strong><br/> Just tell your cab driver to take you to Chelsea Piers, Pier 60. Once inside Chelsea Piers, it is the second parking entrance on the right. Cabs are allowed to enter the parking garage without cost. It&#8217;s that easy!</p>
                <p><strong>By Car:</strong><br/> The Chelsea Piers have covered parking. Park at Pier 60, the second parking entrance on the right. It costs $56 to park for the duration of the wedding. If you plan to drive, please arrive early, as parking may be limited on the day of the wedding. <a href="https://www.chelseapiers.com/also/parking/" target="_blank">More on Parking.</a></p>
                <p><strong>By Public Transportation:</strong><br/> The closest subway stop is the 14th Street A/C/E/L subway station. Exit at 16th Street &amp; 8th Avenue. On exiting the subway station, walk west to 11th avenue, and walk uptown to the Chelsea Piers entrance at 18th street. From within the Chelsea Piers complex, continue uptown and follow the signs for Pier 60. The walk takes approximately 10 minutes.</p>
